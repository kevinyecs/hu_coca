## Introduction

The Hungarian CoCa model is a state-of-the-art image captioning framework that leverages contrastive learning techniques to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions for images. This repository provides the implementation of the model, along with pre-trained weights and scripts for training and evaluation.

## Features

- **Contrastive Learning**: Utilizes contrastive learning to improve captioning accuracy.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained weights for immediate use.
- **Customizable**: Easily fine-tune the model on your own dataset.
- **Efficient Training**: Optimized training scripts for quick and efficient model training.
